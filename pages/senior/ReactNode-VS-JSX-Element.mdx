# React.ReactNode VS JSX.Element


In React, `ReactNode` and `JSX.Element` are both types used to define the type of a component's children. However, they represent slightly different things.

`JSX.Element` represents a single JSX element, while `ReactNode` represents any valid type that can be rendered as a child of a React component. This includes not only JSX elements, but also strings, numbers, arrays, and other types.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```jsx copy
import React, { ReactNode } from 'react';

type Props = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

function MyComponent({ children }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <MyComponent>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </MyComponent>
  );
}

```

In the example above, `MyComponent` accepts a single prop called `children`, which is of type `ReactNode`. This means that the component can accept any valid type as its children.

In the `App` component, we pass two JSX elements (`<h1>` and `<p>`) as children to `MyComponent`. These JSX elements are both of type `JSX.Element`.

If we tried to pass a string, number, or array as a child to `MyComponent`, it would also be valid, because all of these types are included in the `ReactNode` type.

```jsx copy
function App() {
  return (
    <MyComponent>
      123
      ['an', 'array', 'of', 'strings']
    </MyComponent>
  );
}

```

In the example above, we're passing a number and an array of strings as children to `MyComponent`, and both are valid because they are included in the `ReactNode` type.

To provide an example of `JSX.Element`, consider the following code:

```jsx copy
import React from 'react';

type Props = {
  element: JSX.Element;
};

function MyComponent({ element }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {element}
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <MyComponent element={<h1>Hello, world!</h1>} />
  );
}

```

In the example above, `MyComponent` accepts a single prop called `element`, which is of type `JSX.Element`. This means that the component can accept a single JSX element as its child.

In the `App` component, we pass a single JSX element (`<h1>`) as a child to `MyComponent`. This JSX element is of type `JSX.Element`.

If we tried to pass a string, number, or array as a child to `MyComponent`, it would not be valid, because these types are not included in the `JSX.Element` type.

JSX.Element is a type in React that represents a single JSX element. It is used to define the type of a component's child and represents a tree of React elements. It can include any valid HTML-like syntax, such as HTML tags, custom components, or plain text.
