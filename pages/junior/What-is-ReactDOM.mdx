# What is ReactDOM


In the world of web development, there's a superhero named **React**, and it has a trusty sidekick called **ReactDOM**. These two work together to create and change what you see on websites and apps. **But how does it all work?**

Imagine you have a big box of colorful building blocks, and you want to build something amazing. React is the one who decides where each block goes, and ReactDOM is like a magical hand that picks up the blocks and puts them in the right place.

Here's the cool part: React can make changes to what you've built without knocking everything down. It tells ReactDOM, "Hey, move this block here," and ReactDOM does it quickly and neatly. It's like having a super helper who can rearrange your blocks without making a mess.

So, in simple terms, ReactDOM helps React build and change things on your computer screen, and it does it in a super smart and efficient way. It's like magic for the web!

In the grown-up world of web development, ReactDOM is the part of React that takes care of turning your instructions into real things on a web page. It keeps everything looking great and running fast. So, when you're using React, you're actually using React and its trusty sidekick, ReactDOM, to make the web a better place.
